RIP.

Project Axolotl is a minecraft framework of [PrimarineJS's Minecraft Protocol](https://github.com/prismarinejs/node-minecraft-protocol). 

Originally based on [Klasa](https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa), Project Axolotl has become a framework framed around another platform.

The goal of Project Axolotl was to create an easily deployable and expandable minecraft bot client that could preform multiple tasks with different personalities (many accounts).

## Planned Features:
 - IPC Communication Between Instances
 - Efficient Multi-Threading Of Accounts Between Cores
 - Remove Viewing and Management
 - Status Notifications
 - Automated Tasks
 - Chest Inventory (easily find an item in a sea of chests)
 - Remote Takeover (easily take over a bot and return control)

## Current Features:
 - Incredibly fast loading times with deep loading for multi-command commands
 - Full configuration system, easily change the bots behavior on the fly.
 - Full OOP and hot-reloadable pieces.
 - Easily create plugins/pieces to add or modify your client.
 - Easy to use command system, including monitors/inhibitors/event systems.

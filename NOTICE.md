# Axolotl + Klasa

Axolotl uses the framework that once belonged to Klasa.

Klasa was a OOP discord.js bot framework that aimed to be the most feature complete, while feeling like an consistent extension of discord.js.
Their ship has sailed and the project has been discontinued.

```
Klasa has been discontinued
Due to many unprecedented events within the Dirigeants community, Klasa and related projects have now been discontinued and archived.

We would like to thank everyone for using, supporting and contributing to the project. 
```

We use their original framework, but slightly modified and eventually built upon to move on from it. For now, we are using it for minecraft. XD
